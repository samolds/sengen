# Random Sentence Generator

In one of my early CS classes, we built a random sentence generator in Java.
I've been porting the same program to multiple languages as a learning
opportunity and to provide myself with a catalog of differences among
implementations and styles.

If I'm doing something really ugly/wrong/non-idiomatic, in a specific language,
please let me know.
