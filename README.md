# Random Sentence Generator

In one of my early CS classes, we built a random sentence generator in Java. I've been porting
the same program to multiple languages as a learning opportunity and to provide myself with a
catalog of differences among implementations and styles.


### Java
```
cd java
javac GrammarMain.java
java GrammarMain
```


### Python
```
cd python
python grammar_main.py
```


### Ruby
```

```


### Go
```
cd go
go run grammar-main.go grammar-solver.go
```


### C++
```
cd cpp
make
./run
```
