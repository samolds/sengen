Random Sentence Generator
=========================

In one of my early CS classes, we built a random sentence generator in Java. Initially, I ported it to Ruby and Go to freshen up on Ruby and learn Go. Now I plan on continuing to port it to C, C++, JavaScript, and maybe C# to catalog all of the languages that I have learned.


Java
----
```
cd java
javac GrammarMain.java
java GrammarMain
```


Python
------
```
cd python
python grammar_main.py
```


Ruby
----
```
cd ruby
ruby GrammarMain.rb
```


Go

```
cd go
go run grammar-main.go grammar-solver.go
```
